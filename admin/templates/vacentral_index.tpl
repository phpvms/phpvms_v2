<h3>vaCentral Options</h3>
<p>These are your options for vaCentral. Note that your schedules and PIREPs will automatically export, and you don't need to manually do it.</p>

<table class="tablesorter">
<tr>
	<td nowrap=""><strong><a href="<?php echo SITE_URL ?>/admin/index.php/vacentral/sendschedules">
				Send Schedules</a></strong>
	</td>
	<td>This sends out the latest version of your schedules to the vaCentral server.
		You can only do this once a day.</td>
</tr>		
	<td nowrap=""><strong><a href="<?php echo SITE_URL ?>/admin/index.php/vacentral/sendpireps">
				Send PIREPs</a></strong>
	</td>
	<td>This will resend all your PIREPS. Only do this if it has been the first time, and none of your PIREPs are showing up on vaCentral.
		This <strong>will</strong> wipe out all your data on vaCentral, and reset
		your finances and ranking.</td>
